    This app was created by Second Year college student Rebecca Troy.
    <br><br>
    Rebecca studies Software Systems Development at Waterford Institute of Technology and created this website as part of an assignment for a module, Web App Development. She was told to create a web application based on something she was personally interested in, so she chose Disney movie soundtracks as Disney films and their music has been a hit with her since she was a child!
